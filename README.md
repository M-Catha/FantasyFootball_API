# FantasyFootball API
Displays the NFL schedule for the entire season

The two opponents, the score, and the winner of each matchup will be displayed.

Previously implemented using the Fantasy Football Nerd API, but it no longer allows CORS, so the JSON generated by the API will be directly hard-coded until a suitable replacement is found.

Live demo seen here:
